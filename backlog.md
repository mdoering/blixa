# Blixa — Backlog

Consolidated **2026-07-20** from `todo2.md`, `todo.md`, and `features.md`, audited
against the git history and the actual code. Only **open** items are listed here;
everything that the commit audit showed as already implemented was filtered out
(a short summary of what's done is at the bottom). This file supersedes the three
source files.

Rough priority: the **Big features** are the substantial, design-first pieces
(tackled one at a time, starting with the Issue tracker). The rest are smaller,
mostly self-contained follow-ups.

---

## Big features (new — each needs its own design pass)

### 1. Discussions  *(in progress — see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-20-discussions-design.md`)*
A forum-style, per-project discussion tracker keyed on **ORCIDs** (formerly "issue tracker" —
renamed to avoid collision with the validation *Issues*, and because the shape is a conversation thread).

- [x] **Phase 1 — foundation** *(shipped: V27 table, `discussion` API + `DiscussionsPage`)*: per-project
  discussions with **full-text search**, status + author filters, created/modified **sort**, paged;
  **states** for-review → open → rejected/resolved; create (any member), edit/status/delete (author or editor).
- [ ] **Phase 2 — comments + inline links**: markdown comments (author-editable) with `@orcid`,
  `#Genus_species`, `#nameID` rendered as labels; reverse-link from a name to its discussions.
- [ ] **Phase 3 — public visibility + public URL route**: editor marks a discussion PUBLIC; unauthenticated read.
- [ ] **Phase 4 — external API + per-project token**: submissions arrive `state=review`; editors accept → `open`
  (turns COL user comments into discussions).
- [ ] **Phase 5 — follow (heart) + email notifications** (needs SMTP config).
- [ ] **Phase 6 — link (closed) discussions to changes & work locks.**

Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-20-discussions-design.md`.

### 2. AI-assisted curation
- Ask AI to gather info for the **focal taxon**, its **children**, or run a **review**.
- Configure a per-**project** auth token for **Claude / OpenAI / Google / Mistral**.
- Apply **accepted** AI suggestions to the taxon (curator picks what lands).
- Suggest **key literature**; pick which to add to the taxon's refs (single-nomen and taxon lists).
  - The **nomenclatural** reference (for the exact combination) goes on the **name**.
  - The **basionym**'s reference goes on the **basionym**, not the current combination.

### 3. Compare focal taxon with CLB
- Compare the focal taxon against one in ChecklistBank.
- Pick a **dataset**, or **search the name across all datasets** to choose a comparison target.
- Keep a list of **favorite CLB datasets** in project settings.

### 4. Delete options
When deleting a focal taxon, ask what to remove: the focal taxon **only**, the taxon **and its synonyms**, or the **entire subtree**.

### 5. Global admin & user lifecycle
- A global **admin** role (distinct from per-project owner/editor/viewer).
- User **states**: pending → active → disabled.
- Admin screens to list users, approve pending signups, toggle the admin flag.
- (The lighter public **join-request** flow already exists; this is the account-level layer above it.)

## References

- **Abbreviated botanical citations** — abbreviated **author** form and abbreviated **nomenclatural / reference title** for the botanical citation tradition (short *container* title already done). ColDP supports these.
- **CSL-JSON reference import** — reuse the `RefMapping` path that DOI / BibTeX / RIS already use.
- **DOI consolidation** — find DOIs for existing references (Crossref / DataCite lookup on the structured fields).
- **References list total count** — the list endpoint returns a bare `List` (prev/next paging, no total); add a count for a richer MRT table.

## Validation & issues

- **Remaining validation rules** — infraspecific-epithet-vs-parent; dangling pointers (references to deleted usages/refs). *(rank_vs_parent, genus_mismatch, species_epithet_mismatch, genus_year_after_species, year_vs_reference, synonym_of_non_accepted, synonym_without_accepted, duplicate_name, unparsable_name, missing_published_in are all done.)*
- **Evaluate the CLB backend issue enum** — decide which CLB issues are worth surfacing / mapping to Blixa validation rules.
- **Backend test coverage** — `GET /issues?entityId=` filter and the etymology PUT round-trip (code correct on inspection, untested).

## Tools & import

- **DwC-A import adapter** — map Darwin Core terms → ColDP into the shared staging path (reuse GBIF `dwca-io` / CLB readers). *(ColDP and TextTree adapters already exist.)*
- **Homotypic grouping** — select a taxon and group its species/infraspecies homotypically (see CLB backend).
- **GBIF occurrence import into TypeMaterial** — by `occurrenceId` (the field is already carried).
- **Distribution map preview** — via portal-components, using the gazetteer `areaId`.

## UI / polish

- **Tree virtualization** — lazy-per-node is fine for now; needed at Lepidoptera scale (large sibling lists render in full today).
- **nomStatus as a Select** — currently a free-text input showing the enum name.

## Deployment / docs

- Drop the Postgres-only docker compose; document configuring the pg dbname/user/password + Flyway init (confirm whether the backend auto-migrates on boot).
- Rename the "full" docker compose to just `docker-compose.yml`.
